## Comprehensive Guide to Police Traffic Stop Encounters
<details>
<summary>Expand...</summary>

| **What to Expect** | **What to Do/Say** |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| The officer asks for anything other than ID and proof of insurance in a legal stop where they have a valid reason. | "I want to consult an attorney before I answer that." |
| The officer comes up to your window. | "What's your name and badge number?" Officers must provide this information according to their agency policy. |
| The officer asks, "Do you know why I pulled you over?" | "No," and do not admit to anything. Statements can be used against you in court. |
| You're unsure why the officer pulled you over. | "What's your reasonable articulable suspicion for the stop?" |
| The officer asks non-required questions during the stop. | Invoke the 5th Amendment: "I don't answer questions." |
| The officer threatens arrest, lies, etc., if you do not provide identification (only applicable if there's no reasonable suspicion). | Use as a scare tactic. Invoke the 4th & 5th Amendments and refrain from further cooperation. |
| The officer asks to search your vehicle without reasonable suspicion. | "No officer, I do not consent to a search." Contest any illegal search in court. |
| The officer asks if you have weapons or illegal items and requests a search. | "I do mind," or "I do not consent to a search," to deny consent. |
| The officer issues a ticket or citation. | Accept the ticket without argument. You can contest the citation later in court. |
| The officer instructs you to exit the vehicle. | Comply with the order. Physical resistance can lead to arrest or harm. |
| The traffic stop seems unnecessarily prolonged without cause. | Politely inquire, "Am I free to go?" If detained without cause, remember this for a legal challenge. |
| Encounter escalates without clear reason. | Remain calm. Say, "I am not resisting, but I do not consent to any search." Document the encounter if possible. |
| You're detained or arrested. | Clearly state, "I am invoking my right to remain silent and wish to speak with an attorney." Do not resist arrest. |

## Police Physical/Verbal Tactics
<details>
<summary>Expand...</summary>

| ``Pulled Over Help`` |
|-|
| #1 Be as respectful and cooperative as possible BUT still within YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. |
| Police will touch the back of your vehicle to leave fingerprints/DNA for evidence they had came in contact with your vehicle for later inciminating evidence if subject. |
| Never admit anything to a cop; Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. |
| When pulled over, answer the required questions the cop asks you then INVOKE THE 5TH & stay quiet. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. |

| ``Extreme`` |
| Police ARE allowed to search & take your garbage outside. The garbage doesn’t belong to you anymore, it’s the government’s property then. |
| Police have circular tube tracking beacons they can shoot from the front of their cars to your car to track you down if you do escape. (These devices are only used on the modern police interceptors or undercover ones) Example: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V36O09QQpnI) also [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXb9UDWE_aw)|
| Police WILL lie to you about almost anything (except laws & having a warrant) to get you to confess to something. During polygraph tests they’ll even lie to you about if you were telling the truth or not. |
| Police might offer you a drink at their station or somewhere else to obtain your fingerprints/DNA. It’s their property. |
