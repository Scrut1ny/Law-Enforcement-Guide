## Police Traffic Stop Encounter; *Step-by-Step* Instructions
| ``What to expect`` | ``What to do/say`` |
|-|-|
| The officer asks for ANYTHING (*other than ID and proof of insurence in a actual LEGAL stop where they DO have a valid reason*) | Tell the officer "*I want to consult an attorney before I answer that*" |
| The officer comes up to your window. | Ask the officer "*What's your name & badge number*" - The officer HAS to provide you with this info by their Agency Policy. |
| The officer says "*Do you know why I pulled you over?*" | Inform the officer "*No*", DO NOT admit to anything! Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. |
| The officer pulls you over, but you don't know why. | Ask the officer "*Whats your reasonable articulable suspicion for the stop?*" |
| The officer asks you non-required questions during the stop. | Plead/Invoke the 5th amendment and specify "*I don't answer questions.*" |
| The officer says they'll arrest you, *lie*, etc if you do not provide Identification. (Only reject if the officer doesn't have any reasonable articulable suspicion.) | Don't worry, it's a scare tactic police use to obtain your info. Plead/Invoke the 4th & 5th amendment, and don't cooperate with the officer. |
| The officer asks to search your vehicle (*without any reasonable articulable suspicion*) | Simply tell the officer "*No officer, I don't concent to a search.*" If the officer searches it anyway without any RAS; that's called an illegal search that you may sue them for. |
| The officer asks "*Do you have any weapons or anything illegal in your car?*" you respond with "*no*", they then follow up with that question with another and ask "*Do you mind if we take a look?*" | This is a trick question police use to obtain consent to search your vehicle; respond with "*Officer I do mind*" or "*Officer I don't concent to a search*". |

## Police Physical/Verbal Tactics
| ``Pulled Over Help`` |
|-|
| #1 Be as respectful and cooperative as possible BUT still within YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. |
| Police will touch the back of your vehicle to leave fingerprints/DNA for evidence they had came in contact with your vehicle for later inciminating evidence if subject. |
| Never admit anything to a cop; Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. |
| When pulled over, answer the required questions the cop asks you then INVOKE THE 5TH & stay quiet. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. |

| ``Extreme`` |
| Police ARE allowed to search & take your garbage outside. The garbage doesn’t belong to you anymore, it’s the government’s property then. |
| Police have circular tube tracking beacons they can shoot from the front of their cars to your car to track you down if you do escape. (These devices are only used on the modern police interceptors or undercover ones) Example: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V36O09QQpnI) also [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXb9UDWE_aw)|
| Police WILL lie to you about almost anything (except laws & having a warrant) to get you to confess to something. During polygraph tests they’ll even lie to you about if you were telling the truth or not. |
| Police might offer you a drink at their station or somewhere else to obtain your fingerprints/DNA. It’s their property. |
