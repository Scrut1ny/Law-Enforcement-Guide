#### Police Equipment
| ``Bands`` | ``Info`` |
|-|-|
| X Band | Least used, almost no cops use it. Undercover cops use it potentially ðŸ‘® (1 occurrence) |
| K Band | Could be a cop, very unlikely though. Many are false alerts (automatic doors) that happen. ðŸ‘® (1 occurrence) |
| Ka Band | Most commonly used by cops, false alerts are super rare. |

#### Police Verbal Tactics
| ``Pulled Over Help`` |
|-|
| Police Tactics Police touch back of your car to leave fingerprints + DNA for evidence they had came in contact with your car. |
| Police & You Never ever admit anything to a cop; it will get held against you in the court of law. |
| Police & You If you get pulled over, answer the required questions the cop asks you then INVOKE THE 5TH & stay quiet. Anything you say can & will be held against you in the court of law. |
| ``Extreme`` |
| Police Tactics Police ARE allowed to search & take your garbage outside because it doesnâ€™t belong to you anymore, itâ€™s the governmentâ€™s property then. |
| Police Tactics Police have circular tube tracking beacons they can shoot from the front of their cars to your car to track you down if you do escape. (These devices are only used on the modern police interceptors or undercover ones) |
| Police Tactics Police WILL lie to you about almost anything (except laws & having a warrant) to get you to confess to something. Even during polygraph tests theyâ€™ll lie to you about telling the truth or not. |
| Police Tactics Police might offer you a drink @ their station or somewhere else to obtain your fingerprints + DNA. Itâ€™s their property. |
