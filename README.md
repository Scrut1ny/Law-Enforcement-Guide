#### Police Equipment
| ``Bands/other`` | ``Info`` | ``States`` |
|-|-|-|
| ``X Band`` | X band radar is defined as radar waves that fall between 8.0ghz and 12ghz, but law enforcement X band radar guns operate universally on 10.5ghz. This is the oldest type of licensed police radar frequency, and is not widely used anymore. It does still exist, so we don’t recommend turning off X band in your settings – it is mostly found in rural areas, or in areas where police departments did not have adequate funding to upgrade to more modern radar guns. | ``States that use X-Band: Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia. Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, South Dakota, New Mexico, Hawaii, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wyoming.`` |
| ``K Band`` | K band radar is the chunk of radar frequency that stretches from 18ghz-27ghz. Luckily for us, police K band radar operates strictly at 24.125 and 24.15ghz. In the law enforcement world, K band radar began to be adopted a couple decades ago as a higher-performance alternative to X band radar. | ``States that use K-Band: *`` |
| ``Ka Band`` | First introduced in 1983, Ka band radar is the “latest and greatest” law enforcement radar that is currently allowed to be used (all police radar is regulated by the FCC). Ka band is comprised of radar waves between 33.4 and 36.0ghz. Unfortunately for radar detector users, Ka band is slightly more complex than X and K bands. While X and K band police radar guns operate on just one or two frequencies, KA band guns operate on as many as five. | ``States that use Ka-Band: *`` |
| ``POP`` | When police started using radar to catch people speeding, people started using radar detectors to be alerted to police presence. In response to this, police started using POP. POP radar’s main use is to defeat the use of radar detectors. The radar works by sending out very short bursts of radar. The idea is that the short bursts won’t be long enough to trigger the radar detector. The bursts are supposed to be long enough though to detect the vehicle’s speed. POP is not a popular method of detection for police. Because the bursts are so short, it makes reading the speed of vehicles difficult. Courts have ruled consistently that the readings are not trustworthy. | ``States that use POP: Florida, North Carolina, New Jersey, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, & Hawaii.`` |
| ``Laser`` | Laser is unique on this list, it doesn’t use radar that operates on microwave frequencies. Laser uses a light beam that is aimed at one particular vehicle. This is the most accurate form of speed detection because the officer knows exactly which car is speeding. Drivers also have no warning when they are about to have laser used on them. The only way you can defeat an officer using Laser is by using a laser jammer. | ``States that use Laser: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Connecticut, Delaware, District Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, & Wyoming.`` |
| ``ENRAD`` | ENRAD is not a common form of speed detection. Only Pennsylvania uses this method. The officer uses a stationary device to detect speed further down the road. Two metal U-shaped structures are set up across from each other on either side of the road. The one U-shaped structure has transmitters. The second U-shaped structure has receivers. The transmitters send two infrared beams of light into the two receivers. As the vehicle is passing through the two beams of light, the device calculates how long it took. Then the speed calculation is sent to a police car down the road. The local agencies of Pennsylvania are the users of this particular police radar method. | ``States that use ENRAD: Pennsylvania.`` |
| ``VASCAR`` | This is the manual form of speed detection by police. An officer will stand by a stationary object with a stopwatch. When the vehicle passes that object he will start the stopwatch. When the vehicle passes another predetermined stationary object he will stop the stopwatch. To determine the vehicle’s speed the officer divides the distance by time. VASCAR is unique because it can be used from a moving or stationary police car. | ``States that use VASCAR: Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, Wisconsin, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Washington.``|
| ``Automated`` | Automated speed detectors are permanently installed on the side of the road to monitor traffic. These types of cameras are often used by news channels for traffic updates. The camera can also be set up to determine the traffic’s speed on the road. Often times the system is connected to a plate recognition system to assign tickets automatically. | ``States that use Automated: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, Wyoming.``|

#### Police Physical/Verbal Tactics
| ``Pulled Over Help`` |
|-|
| #1 Be as respectful and cooperative as possible BUT still within YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. |
| Police will touch the back of your vehicle to leave fingerprints/DNA for evidence they had came in contact with your vehicle for later inciminating evidence if needed. |
| Never admit anything to a cop; Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. |
| When pulled over, answer the required questions the cop asks you then INVOKE THE 5TH & stay quiet. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. |
| ``Extreme`` |
| Police ARE allowed to search & take your garbage outside. The garbage doesn’t belong to you anymore, it’s the government’s property then. |
| Police have circular tube tracking beacons they can shoot from the front of their cars to your car to track you down if you do escape. (These devices are only used on the modern police interceptors or undercover ones) Example: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V36O09QQpnI) also [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXb9UDWE_aw)|
| Police WILL lie to you about almost anything (except laws & having a warrant) to get you to confess to something. During polygraph tests they’ll even lie to you about if you were telling the truth or not. |
| Police might offer you a drink at their station or somewhere else to obtain your fingerprints/DNA. It’s their property. |
