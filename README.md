#### Police Equipment
| ``Bands`` | ``Info`` |
|-|-|
| X Band | Least used, almost no cops use it. Undercover cops use it potentially ðŸ‘® (1 occurrence) |
| K Band | Could be a cop, very unlikely though. Many are false alerts (automatic doors) that happen. ðŸ‘® (1 occurrence) |
| Ka Band | Most commonly used by cops, false alerts are super rare. |

#### Police Physical/Verbal Tactics
| ``Pulled Over Help`` |
|-|
| #1 Be as respectful and cooperative as possible BUT still within YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. |
| Police will touch the back of your vehicle to leave fingerprints/DNA for evidence they had came in contact with your vehicle for later inciminating evidence if needed. |
| Never admit anything to a cop; Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. |
| When pulled over, answer the required questions the cop asks you then INVOKE THE 5TH & stay quiet. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. |
| ``Extreme`` |
| Police ARE allowed to search & take your garbage outside. The garbage doesnâ€™t belong to you anymore, itâ€™s the governmentâ€™s property then. |
| Police have circular tube tracking beacons they can shoot from the front of their cars to your car to track you down if you do escape. (These devices are only used on the modern police interceptors or undercover ones) Example: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V36O09QQpnI) also [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXb9UDWE_aw)|
| Police WILL lie to you about almost anything (except laws & having a warrant) to get you to confess to something. During polygraph tests theyâ€™ll even lie to you about if you were telling the truth or not. |
| Police might offer you a drink at their station or somewhere else to obtain your fingerprints/DNA. Itâ€™s their property. |
