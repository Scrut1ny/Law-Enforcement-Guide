#### Police Equipment
| ``Bands`` | ``Info`` |
|-|-|
| ``X Band`` | X band radar is defined as radar waves that fall between 8.0ghz and 12ghz, but law enforcement X band radar guns operate universally on 10.5ghz. This is the oldest type of licensed police radar frequency, and is not widely used anymore. It does still exist, so we don’t recommend turning off X band in your settings – it is mostly found in rural areas, or in areas where police departments did not have adequate funding to upgrade to more modern radar guns. |
| ``K Band`` | K band radar is the chunk of radar frequency that stretches from 18ghz-27ghz. Luckily for us, police K band radar operates strictly at 24.125 and 24.15ghz. In the law enforcement world, K band radar began to be adopted a couple decades ago as a higher-performance alternative to X band radar. |
| ``Ka Band`` | First introduced in 1983, Ka band radar is the “latest and greatest” law enforcement radar that is currently allowed to be used (all police radar is regulated by the FCC). Ka band is comprised of radar waves between 33.4 and 36.0ghz. Unfortunately for radar detector users, Ka band is slightly more complex than X and K bands. While X and K band police radar guns operate on just one or two frequencies, KA band guns operate on as many as five. |

#### Police Physical/Verbal Tactics
| ``Pulled Over Help`` |
|-|
| #1 Be as respectful and cooperative as possible BUT still within YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. |
| Police will touch the back of your vehicle to leave fingerprints/DNA for evidence they had came in contact with your vehicle for later inciminating evidence if needed. |
| Never admit anything to a cop; Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. |
| When pulled over, answer the required questions the cop asks you then INVOKE THE 5TH & stay quiet. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. |
| ``Extreme`` |
| Police ARE allowed to search & take your garbage outside. The garbage doesn’t belong to you anymore, it’s the government’s property then. |
| Police have circular tube tracking beacons they can shoot from the front of their cars to your car to track you down if you do escape. (These devices are only used on the modern police interceptors or undercover ones) Example: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V36O09QQpnI) also [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXb9UDWE_aw)|
| Police WILL lie to you about almost anything (except laws & having a warrant) to get you to confess to something. During polygraph tests they’ll even lie to you about if you were telling the truth or not. |
| Police might offer you a drink at their station or somewhere else to obtain your fingerprints/DNA. It’s their property. |
