#### Police Equipment
| ``Bands/other`` | ``Info`` | ``States`` |
|-|-|-|
| ``X Band`` | X band (around 10.5 GHz) is the oldest technology and least common. With its huge antennas, X band has been phased out of most of the country, except for Ohio, New Jersey, and a few rural places across the country. Since you’ll get false alerts from some shopping center door openers, most people now shut off X band detection altogether. | ``States that use X-Band: Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia. Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, South Dakota, New Mexico, Hawaii, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wyoming.`` |
| ``K Band`` | K band is newer and operates around 24 GHz. Police use K band throughout most of the US. Unfortunately there’s a lot of other sources of K band besides police radar including speed signs, automatic door openers, and many new vehicles with blind spot monitor (BSM) radar and smart cruise control. For that reason, K band false alerts are common and you’ll want a modern detector with good false alert filtering. | ``States that use K-Band: *`` |
| ``Ka Band`` | Ka is the newest and most common band and you’ll find it on 33.8, 34.7, and 35.5 GHz. It has the smallest antennas (because it uses the highest frequencies). Ka false positives are also pretty rare so if your detector alerts to Ka, pay attention. | ``States that use Ka-Band: *`` |
| ``POP`` | When police started using radar to catch people speeding, people started using radar detectors to be alerted to police presence. In response to this, police started using POP. POP radar’s main use is to defeat the use of radar detectors. The radar works by sending out very short bursts of radar. The idea is that the short bursts won’t be long enough to trigger the radar detector. The bursts are supposed to be long enough though to detect the vehicle’s speed. POP is not a popular method of detection for police. Because the bursts are so short, it makes reading the speed of vehicles difficult. Courts have ruled consistently that the readings are not trustworthy. | ``States that use POP: Florida, North Carolina, New Jersey, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, & Hawaii.`` |
| ``Lidar / Laser`` | Laser is unique on this list, it doesn’t use radar that operates on microwave frequencies. Laser uses a light beam that is aimed at one particular vehicle. This is the most accurate form of speed detection because the officer knows exactly which car is speeding. Drivers also have no warning when they are about to have laser used on them. The only way you can defeat an officer using Laser is by using a laser jammer. | ``States that use Laser: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Connecticut, Delaware, District Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, & Wyoming.`` |
| ``ENRAD`` | ENRAD is not a common form of speed detection. Only Pennsylvania uses this method. The officer uses a stationary device to detect speed further down the road. Two metal U-shaped structures are set up across from each other on either side of the road. The one U-shaped structure has transmitters. The second U-shaped structure has receivers. The transmitters send two infrared beams of light into the two receivers. As the vehicle is passing through the two beams of light, the device calculates how long it took. Then the speed calculation is sent to a police car down the road. The local agencies of Pennsylvania are the users of this particular police radar method. | ``States that use ENRAD: Pennsylvania.`` |
| ``VASCAR`` | This is the manual form of speed detection by police. An officer will stand by a stationary object with a stopwatch. When the vehicle passes that object he will start the stopwatch. When the vehicle passes another predetermined stationary object he will stop the stopwatch. To determine the vehicle’s speed the officer divides the distance by time. VASCAR is unique because it can be used from a moving or stationary police car. | ``States that use VASCAR: Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, Wisconsin, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Washington.``|
| ``Automated`` | Automated speed detectors are permanently installed on the side of the road to monitor traffic. These types of cameras are often used by news channels for traffic updates. The camera can also be set up to determine the traffic’s speed on the road. Often times the system is connected to a plate recognition system to assign tickets automatically. | ``States that use Automated: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, Wyoming.``|

### Police Traffic Stop; *Step-by-Step* Instructions
| ``What to expect`` | ``What to do/say`` |
|-|-|
| The officer pulls you over, but you don't know why. | Whats your reasonable articulable suspicion for pulling me over officer? |
| The officer asks you non-required questions during the stop. | Plead/Invoke the 5th amendment and specify "*I don't answer questions.*" |
| The officer says they'll arrest you, *lie*, etc if you do not provide Identification. (Only reject if the officer doesn't have any reasonable articulable suspicion.) | Don't worry, it's a scare tactic police use to obtain your info. Plead/Invoke the 4th & 5th amendment, and don't cooperate with the officer. |
| The officer says/asks to search your vehicle (*without any reasonable articulable suspicion*) | Simply tell the officer "*No officer, I don't concent to a search.*" If the officer searches it anyway without any RAS; that's called an illegal search that you may sue them for. |
|  |  |

### Police Physical/Verbal Tactics
| ``Pulled Over Help`` |
|-|
| #1 Be as respectful and cooperative as possible BUT still within YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. |
| Police will touch the back of your vehicle to leave fingerprints/DNA for evidence they had came in contact with your vehicle for later inciminating evidence if subject. |
| Never admit anything to a cop; Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. |
| When pulled over, answer the required questions the cop asks you then INVOKE THE 5TH & stay quiet. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. |

| ``Extreme`` |
| Police ARE allowed to search & take your garbage outside. The garbage doesn’t belong to you anymore, it’s the government’s property then. |
| Police have circular tube tracking beacons they can shoot from the front of their cars to your car to track you down if you do escape. (These devices are only used on the modern police interceptors or undercover ones) Example: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V36O09QQpnI) also [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXb9UDWE_aw)|
| Police WILL lie to you about almost anything (except laws & having a warrant) to get you to confess to something. During polygraph tests they’ll even lie to you about if you were telling the truth or not. |
| Police might offer you a drink at their station or somewhere else to obtain your fingerprints/DNA. It’s their property. |
